Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Day 1

Figuring out how to set up an Angular project environment because this is new technology to me.

## Day 2

Learn how to code in Angular and what each implemented file does.

## Day 3

Implemented some code to get a video feed and started to import firebase api.

## Needs work

I will continue to work on this becuase I like this challenge. 
The video feed needs work and still need to create files to store to firebase.

## Citations

Almost all the code to learn how to display a video feed came from `https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/how-to-record-a-video-using-angular/`.
